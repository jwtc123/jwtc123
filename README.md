<!-- Add your details -->

I am __Justin Wong__, a recent Business & Data analytics graduate from the RISE by DigitalBCG Academy by Boston Consulting Group, taught by global BCG consultants and GAMMA data scientists. Also, I have domain knowledge in trading Bond Futures and in the recent year, Cryptocurrencies. Even earlier in my career, I worked on hedge fund accounts, and private banking corporate trust accounts. I am now looking to pivot into the realm of data science to make the world a better place one small step at a time.

Take a look at my recent projects...
