(This is not me if you are wondering.
I just happen to like this pic a lot!)

<!-- Add your details -->

I am __Justin Wong__, a recent Business & Data analytics graduate from the RISE by DigitalBCG Academy by Boston Consulting Group, taught by global BCG consultants and GAMMA data scientists. Also, I have domain knowledge in Bond Derivatives Trading and in the recent year, Cryptocurrencies. Even earlier in my career, I worked on hedge fund accounts, and private banking corporate trust accounts. I am now looking to pivot into the realm of data science to make the world a better place one small step at a time.

I'm targeting to improve on SQL, learn XGBoost and Solidity. These are my targets for the next 3-6 months.
In the mean time, take a look at my recent projects...

#### Pet project
![alt text](https://github.com/jwtc123/jwtc123/blob/main/images/BTC_vs_Funding_Rate_analysis.jpg)

A visual EDA study on possible trend change observed in Bitcoin price given changes in Bybit's Funding Rate. The Bybit 8-hourly dataset (Aug 2020 - Oct 2021) was merged with BTC hourly dataset (Oct 2020 - Oct 2021), and analysis was done on data in date range 1st Oct 2020 to 28th Oct 2021. <br> 
<br>
Visual Prediction: Mini uptrend in BTC price in November (No Machine Learning Models used here) <br>

#### Sentosa project
Sentosa is one of Asia‚Äôs leading leisure destinations and Singapore‚Äôs premier island resort getaway. This 500-hectare island resort is home to an exciting array of themed attractions, award-winning spa retreats, lush rainforests, golden sandy beaches, resort accommodations, world-renowned golf courses, a deep-water yachting marina and luxurious residences. The Resorts World Sentosa and the Universal Studios theme park are also on this island. <br>

Below are parts of the project presentation slides: <br>

Detailed Project Workflow:
![alt text](https://github.com/jwtc123/jwtc123/blob/main/images/Sentosa_project_workflow.jpg) <br>
<br>
I drew up this conceptual blueprint while brainstorming for a measure to determine bus overcrowding - Bus Passenger Count. Don't mind the incorrect codes as this was drawn up right before pandas, statistics and machine learning were taught in the course. <br>

Brainstorming the above solution steps was like a mini-project in itself and coding these 4 steps was challenging really, especially when I didn't have any programming background before I started this course. <br>
<br>
Next, getting ready the initial features chosen for inputting into the Machine Learning Model. Note that I have only included the combined feature heatmap pic for ALL bus routes for illustration purposes. Each route has such a customized correlation heatmap as part of the EDA. Features that have weak correlations ( < |0.08| ) to Bus Passenger Count were not thrown into the model.

Above is the Time Series SARIMAX model prediction accuracy table and charts. An average R^2 score of 0.65 for accuracy was achieved, and BCG Gamma scientists - our trainers informed that the best possible theoretical R^2 score for this type of Time Series optimization model was in the region of '0.6 something'. Each of the 3 Bus Routes are separately modeled with their final selected features after many rounds of trial and error. The final set of features are not 100% same as the initial features chosen as the model is able to calculate weightages given to each feature. <br>
<br>
With a pretty accurate SARIMAX model, predictions could now be made. The dataset given to us by Sentosa was from Jan 2021 to Mar 2021. April's first week predictions are as shown below: <br>

The above is the MVP interface for illustrative purposes only, which also is the final output of this project. Once developed, it can be integrated with Sentosa Development Corporation's bus operations.

<br>
The infamous move 78 in 2016 which caused AlphaGo to lose it's first and last time to a human player. If you are interested in the series of games between AlphaGo and Lee Seedol (one of the strongest professional player ever), have a read on this article: https://medium.com/@StephenMartindale/alphago-vs-lee-se-dol-game-four-a0604ce0241c <br>
<br>
I picked up this game in 2014 and became serious about it in 2016 after seeing AlphaGo beat Lee Seedol, and ultimately got my dan certification by the Singapore Weiqi Association in 2019. Seeing first hand Deepmind's AlphaGo (Reinforcement Machine Learning Model)'s almost perfect record and later AlphaZero's (Deep Neural Network Model) complete dominance over AlphaGo convinced me to get into the world of Machine Learning. <br>
<br>
To get strong in this game requires one to be able to zoom in and zoom out to have a macro-level view to plan, prioritize, evaluate, develop, trade, while being meticulous on the micro-level. It helps train one's skills like patience, timing, awareness, calmness-under-pressure, opportunity-recognition, observation, decision-making, creativity, efficiency, logic/math, critical thinking. <br>
